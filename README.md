# Snake-Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is played on a canvas element and controlled using the arrow keys on the keyboard.

## Getting Started
To play the game, simply open the link Snake-Game in your web browser. The game will start automatically, and you can control the snake using the arrow keys on your keyboard.

## How to Play
The objective of the game is to eat as many apples as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body. As the snake eats more apples, it will grow in length and move faster.

<h3>Up:</h3> Press the up arrow key to move the snake upwards.<br>
Down: Press the down arrow key to move the snake downwards.<br>
